# Running-to-Reality
Welcome to Running to Reality!
Tired of the same old daily grind? Burnt out from the chaos of real life?
Let’s hit start and run—run far away from the harsh truths we all face.
Inspired by the classic offline game Dino Run, this endless runner throws you into a symbolic journey where each jump is a choice, and every obstacle is a challenge life throws your way.
How long can you keep running before reality catches up?
